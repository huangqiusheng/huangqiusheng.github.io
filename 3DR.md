title: 3D reconstruction (for Autonomous Driving Scenario)
permalink: /3DR/
---

## Overview
The purpose here is to create a library of digital assets for an autonomous driving simulation platform, i.e. class reconstructions such as cars.

Given that autonomous vehicle data collection typically takes place on actual roads, each car's actual field of view is limited to less than 180 degrees, which poses significant difficulties for reconstruction. Despite vehicles having inherent symmetry, they do not capture the entirety of their surroundings in a comprehensive manner.
